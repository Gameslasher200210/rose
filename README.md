Write a Java program that takes a month number as input (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.) and prints the name of the corresponding month. If the user enters a number outside the range of 1 to 12, the program should print "Invalid month number."

Calculator Application:
Create a basic calculator application that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Use methods to handle each operation. For example, you can have methods like add, subtract, multiply, and divide to perform the respective operations. (i am expecting 4 methods, add, subtract, multiply, and divide, they should take in two parameter);

add should be non - static void method
subtract should be a non static
divide should be a static boolean
multiply should be a non static void

create a method that counts 1 to 10 using any loop.
